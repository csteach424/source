### Readme - JS Plain - OO Prototypes - Basic Prototype Inheritance

A brief demo of inheritance with prototypes.

  * FN: define constructor for object instantiation
    * two constructors defined
    * local variables defined
  * VARS:
    * local scope variables defined for both constructor functions
  * PROTO:
    * prototype for Archive set to instantiated object of Library
  * Use:
    * archiveRecord object instantiated with constructor for Archive...
    * tests with `instanceOf` to check instantiation of archiveRecord
      * i.e. constructor used for object...
    * check access to local constructor variables
      * i.e. properties on the instantiated object
